    Intelligent Environments (IE) refer to physical spaces in which IT and other pervasive computing technology are
    woven and used to achieve specific goals for the user, the environment or both. IEs have the ultimate objective
    of enriching user experience, better managing and increasing user awareness of that environment.
</p>
<p>
    As in previous editions of the Intelligent Environments conference, a number of workshops will complement the
    main conference program. Papers accepted in any of the workshops will be published in the proceedings of the
    event, which will be an open access volume in the Book Series on Ambient Intelligence and Smart Environments
    Series (IOS Press). As of 2015, the Workshops Proceedings published by this Book Series are indexed in the
    Conference Proceedings Citation Index – Science (CPCI-S) by Thomson Reuters.
</p>
<p>
    The IE2023 workshops will be held within two days during the conference. Half-day, full-day and even two-day
    workshops are possible depending on the number of participants.

            <p class="grey_color"><b>Overview:</b></p>
            <p>Self-learning systems are artificial agents able to acquire and renew knowledge over time without
                hard coding. These are adaptive systems whose functions improve by a learning process based
                -typically- on the method of trial and error. A self-learning system initially interacts with its
                users or surrounding environment by attempting and observing the changes produced by its actions.
                This workshop will focus on the design, implementation and exploitation of self-learning features
                within an Intelligent Environment or some of its components. The workshop will represent an
                opportunity for academia and industry to debate the state-of-the-art challenges and open issues.</p>

            <p class="grey_color"><b>Overview:</b></p>
            <p>Intelligent environments are without a doubt a great feat of technology, one of many that
                characterize the society of information and technology we now experience. Despite bringing
                recognizable advantages to the fulfilment of human needs by adapting the ecosystem around human
                intentionalities and activities, intelligent environments do bring about difficult challenges to the
                creation of normative frameworks that regulate their usage. Drafting and applying legal norms that
                are suitable to ever-evolving technologies means that, on one hand, not only legal practitioners,
                legislators and scholars must be prepared to closely monitor technological advances to adequately
                prepare and apply suitable legal norms, and, on the other hand, do so in a pace that is
                traditionally not common in law. This workshop is intended to create a forum of discussion between
                those who share a common interest in this area of intersection between technology (intelligent
                environments) and law.</p>

            <p class="grey_color"><b>Overview:</b></p>
            <p>The 1st Workshop on Ubicomp Environments and Social Robots Applications aims to enable synergy among
                key aspects, such as, how ubicomp environments should be designed to benefit from robot
                interactions, how society will influence the social behavior of a robot, tools to support the design
                and development of real-time applications. This workshop provides a venue for members from a range
                of international institutions, including universities, research labs, and industry to exchange ideas
                and experiences, analyze, present, and discuss latest research and development issues, and propose
                theoretical foundations related to research on combining solutions for developing IoT applications
                on ubicomp environments. This synergistic focus will enforce the engineering of intelligent and
                innovative solutions based in IoT to guide their design and to promote the development of new
                approaches (architectures, tools, and methodologies) for Ubicomp.</p>

            <p class="grey_color"><b>Overview:</b></p>
            <p>Every day, more information moves through social networks. Users publish content in the form of text,
                images, video, audio or a combination of them to express their opinions, relate facts that are
                happening at that moment or show situations of interest. Also, this content is published using
                mobile devices that are commonly equipped with different outdoor and indoor positioning technologies
                (e.g., GPS, RFID or Bluetooth) that allows to attach certain geo-tags to the users' posts as
                meta-data. This opens a new line of research related to the analysis and interpretation of the
                multi-modal information flowing through online social networks. However, the fusion, integration and
                analysis of this heterogeneous data poses serious challenges so as to come up to truly effective
                services leveraging social-media content in fields like predictive analytics or event detection.</p>
            <p>This workshop focuses on intelligent solutions for social-media processing that considers such an
                inherent heterogeneity. This way, mechanisms able to extract knowledge from multimedia data posted
                by users in online social media platforms or the fusion of different types of data coming from these
                feeds would be of special interest.</p>

            </p>

            <p class="grey_color"><b>Overview:</b></p>
            <p>Our modern society faces multiple challenges, including an increased number of older people, an
                increasing social gap and (health) differences between people of diverse socioeconomic backgrounds,
                a shortage of qualified and specialised professionals, and loneliness. These challenges affect our
                (perceived) health and life expectancy and make great demands on the self-, and collaborative
                management.</p>
            <p>A growing number of studies reveal how the living environment can preserve and promote our social
                connections, health and (perceived) quality of life. Having some form of 'community' and social
                interaction in the neighbourhood is a precondition for creating informal networks. Especially for
                people in vulnerable situations, the (design of the) outdoor space is decisive for establishing
                social cohesion.</p>
            <p>The concept of 'public familiarity', which is used to indicate the relationship between the living
                environment and social interaction, potentially enhances good neighbourliness. It refers to short,
                repeated encounters between neighbours and contributes to feelings of safety and social acceptance.
                Fourth places, such as squares or parks, that function as the "living room" of a neighbourhood are
                essential in this regard.</p>
            <p>Artificial intelligence solutions and art are also rich in interaction and are more often used to
                promote social interaction in these 'living rooms'. In doing so, public space not only 'facilitates'
                social interaction but also 'stimulates' it.</p>
            <p>Ethical issues of these AI-based places should certainly not be overlooked. However, some
                researchers argue that nudging is manipulative as psychological processes (such as priming and
                framing) affect people's behaviour unconsciously. Much data on the behaviour and subtle behavioural
                influenced by AI-interventions are collected. This knowledge brings responsibility for finding out
                whether the impact is desirable.</p>
            <p>Therefore, this international workshop sets out to explore if and how smart technologies can turn
                semi-public spaces into resilient communities. More specifically, we focus on how (semi-)public
                spaces can contribute to encountering and strengthening social connections between neighbourhood
                residents. The aim is to explore and understand factors that influence the design of AI-based
                environments where human scale and ethical values are integrated.</p>
            <p>Ensuring the social embedding and sustainable use of these solutions require the involvement of all
                stakeholders, particularly citizens, in the design process. The workshop thereby explores the
                dynamics between AI, artwork, place-making, and social health. It investigates the design and
                participation process, ethical matters, as well as the validity and (socio-economic and emotional)
                impact of these AI-based solutions.</p>

            <p class="grey_color"><b>Overview:</b></p>
            <p>The goal of the 2st Workshop on Edge AI for Smart Agriculture (EAISA) is to provide a forum for
                scientists, engineers and researchers to discuss and exchange novel ideas, results, experiences and
                work-in-process on aspects related to the use and deployment of Edge Artificial Intelligence for
                smart and sustainable agriculture.</p>
            <p>
                While intelligent systems for smart agriculture (and smart cities, in a wider view) are becoming
                widely available, they are mostly based on remote facilities for analysis and decision-making.
                Bringing AI to the edge is a way to cope with the many constraints such as limited communication
                capabilities and power supply. This also brings new challenges, such as energy efficiency and
                adapting AI models to low-capacity processors.</p>
            <p>
                Attendees will appreciate and benefit from multidisciplinary exchanges on these hot topics. Through
                this workshop, we expect people from various communities to meet and exchange during the meetings
                and specific slots of time will be dedicated to open discussions.</p>

            <p>The workshop will bring together researchers from both industry and academia from the various
                disciplines to contribute to this new edition of the International Workshop on Intelligent
                Environments Supporting Healthcare and Well-Being. This event previously joined forces with the
                International Workshop “PervaSense – Situation recognition and medical data analysis in Pervasive
                Health environments” and the workshop on “Smart Healthcare and Healing Environments”. Healthcare
                environments (within the hospital and the home) are extremely complex and challenging to manage from
                an IT and IS perspective, as they are required to cope with an assortment of patient conditions
                under various circumstances with a number of resource constraints. Pervasive healthcare technologies
                seek to respond to a variety of these pressures by integrating them within existing healthcare
                services. It is essential that intelligent pervasive healthcare solutions are developed and
                correctly integrated to assist health care professionals in delivering high levels of patient care.
                It is equally important that these pervasive solutions are used to empower patients and relatives
                for self-care and management of their health to provide seamless access for health care services.

            <p class="grey_color"><b>Overview:</b></p>
            <p>Intelligent Environments (IE) is rising as one of the technical fields with the highest potential to make an impact in daily human life during the near future. Developments in this area are achieved by a complex juxtaposition of complex technical fields. Software is related to the architecture of a building, sensors, a network for data transportation, and different levels of users. Many of these elements are error prone, software is notoriously difficult and even companies like NASA, Microsoft, Intel, BMW, which can afford powerful teams of experienced development teams have paid with lives, economic losses and reputation missing to detect software bugs within their products. Sensors are often unreliable, networks are sometimes unstable and users can put systems to the test in circumstances that were not initially foreseen. Developing this type of systems is therefore complex and given that some applications will be given the tremendous responsibility to take care of humans. Think for example on how much interest there is on the development of systems to support independent living. These systems are intended to give peace of mind to elderly people and their relatives trusting that the system will be able to do many things for them including safety related issues like detecting whether the occupant of the house has fallen or is unwell in some way. Other examples are unmanned cars and other autonomous systems which are supposed to perform tasks for us which can have disastrous consequences should something go wrong.</p><p>Our community should develop appropriate standards and specific methodologies to ensure we do our outmost to deliver safe systems given the current state of the art. Given the specific blend of components in our area of development we cannot just transfer developments in other areas (although of course they should be taken into account to inform the process). This event will aim to bring together developers and researchers to focus on all aspects of the development process that can contribute to make Intelligent Environments and related systems safer and more secure, as well as to provide methodologies that can increase the confidence in these developments.</p>
